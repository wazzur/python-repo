This is a git repo for the coloring problem

the basic program for a random coloring has been completed.

Work to be completed:
write better acceptance and handling of user arguments (add preprocessing function?)
write better/more efficient function for finding closest distances
write comments all over the place
implement new coloring techniques besides random coloring
discuss keeping multiple coloring techniques vs only producing a single, optimal coloring vs user selection of technique(s)
verify code functionality with in-class vagrant machines
add third dimension
possibly create a pretty GUI
