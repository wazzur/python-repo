This is a git repo for the coloring problem

the basic program for a random coloring has been completed.

------------------------------------------------------------
9/22:

Work to be completed:
Piyush asked me to use integers with a dictionary to define colors
Piyush also asked to not use numpy import (so this means reworking arrays)
write better acceptance and handling of user arguments (add preprocessing function?)
write better/more efficient function for finding closest distances
write comments all over the place
implement new coloring techniques besides random coloring
discuss keeping multiple coloring techniques vs only producing a single, optimal coloring vs user selection of technique(s)
verify code functionality with in-class vagrant machines
add third dimension
possibly create a pretty GUI

Note: 
I added a few TODO: statements in the code to show 
what needs work at a given time.

--------------------------------------------------------------
9/29 - updated code to be functional with python3
