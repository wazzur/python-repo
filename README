This is a git repo for the coloring problem

the basic program for a random coloring has been completed.

------------------------------------------------------------
9/22:

Work to be completed:
Piyush asked me to use integers instead of strings
Piyush also asked to not use numpy import (so this means reworking arrays)
write better acceptance and handling of user arguments (add preprocessing function?)
write better/more efficient function for finding closest distances
write comments all over the place
implement new coloring techniques besides random coloring
discuss keeping multiple coloring techniques vs only producing a single, optimal coloring vs user selection of technique(s)
verify code functionality with in-class vagrant machines
add third dimension
possibly create a pretty GUI

--------------------------------------------------------------
9/29 - updated code to be functional with python3
--------------------------------------------------------------
10/4 - updated code to be more flexible with argument handling
	added more TODO notes.
	started working on accepting 3D matrixes
--------------------------------------------------------------
10/16 - Completed support for 3D matrixes
	Reworked distance function to remove need for math import.
	Improved function passing
	added small comments
